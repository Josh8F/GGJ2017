# GGJ2017 - Biosonic Escape
## The game:
Global Game Jam 2017 project worked in unity. 
Biosonic Escape is a cooperative game between two players. The game is about a prisoner soldier, blinded after torture, trying to escape from an underground prison with the help of an old ally. He can perceive the world around him by means of the *sound waves* that his ally produces.
