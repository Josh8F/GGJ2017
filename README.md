# GGJ2017 - Project Echo
## The game:
Global Game Jam 2017 project worked in unity. This is a little co-op game made for GGJ with the objective of escaping a simple maze. Player 1 plays as a blind person(first-person-view) who can see sound waves generated by various objects and player 2 plays as a helper(third-person-view) that can generate sound waves to help the first player escape the maze safely.

## Motivation:
We're a group of young game fans and decide to participate in our first GGJ. I think we all have some different motivations to make this project, but the one we have in common is the love for games!
